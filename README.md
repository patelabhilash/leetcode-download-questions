Basically a fork of [yask's repo](https://github.com/yask123/all_leetcode_questions) but I don't think the repo name 'all-leetcode-questions' fits given the smaller amount of questions here.

Repo is updated to work with LeetCode's GraphQL API and only includes the [Blind 75](https://www.teamblind.com/post/New-Year-Gift---Curated-List-of-Top-75-LeetCode-Questions-to-Save-Your-Time-OaM1orEU). The code should theoretically work with any Leetcode question list though. 

Questions are currently only available in PDF format. 

Feel free to submit a PR to include other lists e.g topic specific lists.

### Usage

You can download '.pdf' file from this repo and view it however you want. 

### Building PDF 

This repo relies on WeasyPrint which itself has some annoying dependencies to install. Refer to their [documentation](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/weasyprint/latest/first_steps.html) for platform specific installation steps. 

__NOTE__ For MacOS you may also need to install LibMagic with `brew install libmagic`

Run the following to install other dependencies 
```python
virtualenv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In virtualenv, run `python3 export_all_questions.py` to generate PDF. 

### Updating questions

Add the new question link in the file `question_links.txt` and run `export_all_questions.py` python script. 

To get all questions in a LeetCode list, visit a LeetCode URL with problem links visible on the page e.g `https://leetcode.com/list/xi4ci4ig/`. Open up the dev console and run the following code. Make sure all problem links are visible e.g extend list view > 50 to show all problem links if needed. 

```
var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
var all_links = Array.prototype.slice.call(links);
var problems_str = "";
all_links.forEach(function(val) {
    if (val.href.includes('/problems/') && !val.href.includes('/solution')) {
        problems_str = problems_str.concat(`${val.href}\n`)
    }
});
console.log(problems_str)
```

### get list

To get all questions link list, visit this URL 'https://leetcode.com/problemset/algorithms/', open up the dev console and run following code:

```
var links = document.getElementsByTagName('a');
var all_links =  Array.prototype.slice.call(links);
var p = [];
all_links.forEach(function(val){
     val.href.includes('problems/') && p.push(val.href);
});
console.log(p.join("\r\n"));
```
